## Car exchange

When we want to share a car, we need to be sure that only the owner of the car and the client can make the deal. Indeed, we do not want a third part to come in and request the car in the place of the client.

Moreover, we want that the client and the owner do the exchange in real life. So, we need a proof of that transaction. This is what we call "proof of exchange" comes in.


## Proof of exchange

One possibility to be sure that the exchange occurs is that each participant validate through the blockchain. Thus, a function will change a boolean and say the client/owner have receive the car. However, no exchange has been realize with the client or the owner.

To realize this exchange, a possibility is to generate a random number for each part that will remain secret until the two parties meet in person. Thus, in the real life exchange, we can imagine one party scanning a QR code from the other part sharing the secret code and vice-versa. In the blockchain, only the encrypted number will be store. Thus for validating the exchange, you need to have the code shared by the other part.
